A simple web app meant to let you view your Mastodon archive. After you've downloaded the zip, you can select it in the app or drag and drop the zip into the view. Try this out at: <https://tootviewer.netlify.app>

## Changelog

* 7/3/24: Caching to localStorage, which I may rewrite to IDB. Added a way to clear the cache as well.
* 7/1/24: Added type to filter, it's a bit slow, so may refactor
* 7/1/24: Initial release. Lots to do - like a date filter for messages and maybe simple string filter.
